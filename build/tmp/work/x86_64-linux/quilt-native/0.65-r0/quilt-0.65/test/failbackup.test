	$ mkdir patches

	$ quilt new test.diff
	> Patch %{P}test.diff is now on top

	$ quilt add test.txt
	> File test.txt added to patch %{P}test.diff
	$ cat > test.txt
	< This is test.txt.
	$ quilt refresh
	> Refreshed patch patches/test.diff

What happens when refresh fails because of a permission error?

	$ chmod -w patches
	$ cat > test.txt
	< This is updated test.txt.
	$ quilt refresh --backup
	>~ mv: .*: Permission denied
	$ echo %{?}
	> 1

	$ chmod +w patches
